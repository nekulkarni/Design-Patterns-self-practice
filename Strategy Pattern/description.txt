Problem:

Game characters like king, queen, knight etc can use any one weapon at a time, however they can change their weapons throughout the game.

Details:
Character
Abstract class.
Has a member variable charName and is composed of weaponBehaviour.
The method fight() lets the character fight with his/ her weapon of choice. We are able to set the weapon of choice in runtime through the member method setWeaponOfChoice().
We can also set the weapon of choice compile time by overriding the setWeaponOfChoice() in the child class.

WeaponBehaviour
Interface.
Has a method useWeapon().
All the classes implementing this interface implement this method according to the specific weapon they represent.useWeapon().

King, Queen, Knight
Classes extending Character class.
SwordBehaviour, PoisonBehaviour, AxeBehaviour
Classes implementing WeaponBehaviour interface.
Represent a specific weapon.
